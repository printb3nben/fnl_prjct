 I'm using codeigniter and mostly of my files are php and Github pages currently do not support PHP as it only supports static website so these are the ways on how to open my web app.

1. Dowload the FloresBlog zipped file on github.
2. Extract that in xampp/htdocs/
3. After extracting, go to localhost/phpmyadmin and create a new database and name it as flores_db_blog.
4. After creating database(flores_db_blog), import the flores_db_blog.sql(which is found in my FloresBlog folder).
5. After importing, go to localhost/FloresBlog
6. (if it runs) Click Blogerist and then click Login.
7. If you dont have account please click register and sign up and if you already have please sign in and login.
8. You're in.
